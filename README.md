# Machine Learning 

## Logistic Regression
The objective is to predict which customers are going to leave (churn) using Logistic Regression in Python.

The dataset consists of customer details of a cellular service company. The dataset and the ipynb files (LogisticRegression_Churn.ipynb) can be downloaded from this repository. The dataset is taken from Kaggle.

The accuracy is ~80%

## Random Forest
The objective is to predict if a credit card transaction is a fraud transaction or not.

Dataset used is available on kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

The ipynb files (RandomForest.ipynb) can be downloaded from this repository. 

roc auc score ~0.93, f1 score ~0.85, recall score ~0.79

## Kernel SVM
The objective is to find if revenue will be generated by a customer browsing this e-commerce website based on features like the time they spend on a webpage, if they are returning cutomers etc.

Dataset used is uploaded on this drive and is available on https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset by Sakar, C.O., Polat, S.O., Katircioglu, M. et al. Neural Comput & Applic (2018).

roc_score: ~0.79, accuracy_score: ~0.85, f1_score: ~0.62, recall_score: ~0.70
